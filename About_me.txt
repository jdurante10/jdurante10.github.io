My name is James Durante, I attended Niskayuna Highschool and my birthday is on June 28th. My hobbies include hanging out with friends,
going to car meets, playing baseball, and video games. I have a 9 year old little brother named Jack and a dog named Mario.
I would describe myself as friendly, caring, and a good friend. Over the summer I went to Italy for the first time, meaning it was also
my first time leaving the country. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, as I was able to meet many of my relatives. The only bad part 
of the experience for me, was that near the end of the trip I caught covid.
